# Leach-Energy-Model
This project is done in python language with NumPy and matplotlib module.
In this project, We built LEACH, a clustering-based routing protocol that minimizes global energy usage by distributing the load to all the nodes at different points in time. 

At different times, each node has the burden of acquiring data from the nodes in the cluster, fusing the data to obtain an aggregate signal, and transmitting this aggregate signal to the base station.  

Distributing the energy among the nodes in the network is effective in reducing energy dissipation from a global perspective and enhancing system lifetime. 

1) LEACH reduces communication energy by as much as 8x compared with direct transmission and minimum transmission-energy routing.

2)The ﬁrst node death in LEACH occurs over 8 times later than the ﬁrst node death indirect transmission, minimum-transmission-energy routing, and a static clustering protocol, and the last node death in LEACH occurs over 3 times later than the last node death in the other protocols.
